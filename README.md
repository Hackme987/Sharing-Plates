# Sharing-Plates
Sharing Plates is a platform that connects events with leftover food to local communities in need. It allows venues, weddings, and large parties to donate food to charity or invite students away from home to enjoy a meal. By reducing food waste and supporting those in need, Sharing Plates fosters a sense of community and sustainability.
